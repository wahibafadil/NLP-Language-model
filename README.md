# NLP-Language-Model

## Project Description
This project focuses on implementing n-gram language models for tasks such as text generation, auto-completion, and spell correction. The models are trained and evaluated using various datasets, and the implementation includes methods for preparing data, training models, predicting n-grams, calculating perplexity, generating text, auto-completing text, and correcting spelling errors.
